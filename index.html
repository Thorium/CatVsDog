        <p><strong>Azure Owin F-Sharp:</strong></p>

<p>This is generic cloud based online collaboration/gaming platform.
But because generic sounds bad, let's specify more:</p>

<p>This is a architecture of users (players) and rooms (games).
Users can join rooms. They can chat with other users in the rooms.
Users can co-operate with other room users, e.g. play games.</p>

<p>Claims based authentication:
Facebook / Google+ (/...) external logins are supported </p>

<p>See the high level picture:

<p>The whole system runs in cloud as Windows Azure Worker role.
Worker role hosts OWIN (Katana) based web server. 
Web server hosts (Hateoas) REST-based WebApi for data communication.
And SignalR (Hub) for web-based Publish/Subscribe -pattern to enable
real-time bi-directional communication between users,
usually based on WebSockets. 
Web server tunnel static HTML-files from Windows Azure Blob Storage.</p>

<p>User data is stored to Windows Azure Table Storage 
(which is a NoSQL document database).</p>

<p>Runtime data uses Actor/Agent -based communication:
Each user has an agent. Each room has an agent.
There is (generic strongly typed) control agent class which can 
create other agents. (e.g. one instance for room-agents, one for user-agents)</p>

<p>Programming language is F-Sharp (F#). It is a multi-paradigm 
(functional-first) programming language mainly for .NET environment.
F# related technologies: Fog is used for Azure communication. 
FSharp.Net.Http and FSharp.Web.Http is used for HTTP communication.</p>

<p>This is developed with 
Visual Studio 2012 (Update 4) / Visual Studio 2013 
and Azure SDK 2.2. References are resolved via NuGet. </p>

<p>To run:
Build and run from Visual Studio
See the host console from (task tray icon) Azure Compute Emulator.
There is a line something like: "Starting OWIN at <a href="http://127.255.0.0:81">http://127.255.0.0:81</a>"
(If compute emulator logging works...)
Copy the address and open it with web browser.
(...or you can deploy this to Windows Azure)

<p>Sample HTML-pages are just HTML5 with jQuery and Knockout.js
They are deployed from the wwwroot.zip -file.</p>
