{"name":"Catvsdog","tagline":"Azure Owin FSharp","body":"**Azure Owin F-Sharp:**\r\n\r\nThis is generic cloud based online collaboration/gaming platform.\r\nBut because generic sounds bad, let's specify more:\r\n\r\nThis is a architecture of users (players) and rooms (games).\r\nUsers can join rooms. They can chat with other users in the rooms.\r\nUsers can co-operate with other room users, e.g. play games.\r\n\r\nClaims based authentication:\r\nFacebook / Google+ (/...) external logins are supported \r\n\r\nSee the high level picture: \r\n![Architecture.jpg][1]\r\n\r\nThe whole system runs in cloud as Windows Azure Worker role.\r\nWorker role hosts OWIN (Katana) based web server. \r\nWeb server hosts (Hateoas) REST-based WebApi for data communication.\r\nAnd SignalR (Hub) for web-based Publish/Subscribe -pattern to enable\r\nreal-time bi-directional communication between users,\r\nusually based on WebSockets. \r\nWeb server tunnel static HTML-files from Windows Azure Blob Storage.\r\n\r\nUser data is stored to Windows Azure Table Storage \r\n(which is a NoSQL document database).\r\n\r\nRuntime data uses Actor/Agent -based communication:\r\nEach user has an agent. Each room has an agent.\r\nThere is (generic strongly typed) control agent class which can \r\ncreate other agents. (e.g. one instance for room-agents, one for user-agents)\r\n\r\nProgramming language is F-Sharp (F#). It is a multi-paradigm \r\n(functional-first) programming language mainly for .NET environment.\r\nF# related technologies: Fog is used for Azure communication. \r\nFSharp.Net.Http and FSharp.Web.Http is used for HTTP communication.\r\n\r\nThis is developed with \r\nVisual Studio 2012 (Update 4) / Visual Studio 2013 \r\nand Azure SDK 2.2. References are resolved via NuGet. \r\n\r\nTo run:\r\nBuild and run from Visual Studio\r\nSee the host console from (task tray icon) Azure Compute Emulator.\r\nThere is a line something like: \"Starting OWIN at http://127.255.0.0:81\"\r\n(If compute emulator logging works...)\r\nCopy the address and open it with web browser.\r\n(...or you can deploy this to Windows Azure)\r\n![StartInstructions.jpg][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nSample HTML-pages are just HTML5 with jQuery and Knockout.js\r\nThey are deployed from the wwwroot.zip -file.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot.jpg][3]\r\n\r\n   [1]: https://raw.github.com/Thorium/CatVsDog/master/specifications/Architecture.jpg\r\n   [2]: https://raw.github.com/Thorium/CatVsDog/master/specifications/StartInstructions.jpg\r\n   [3]: https://raw.github.com/Thorium/CatVsDog/master/specifications/Screenshot.jpg\r\n   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
